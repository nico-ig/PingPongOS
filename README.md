# PingPongOS

A simple operating system implementation for educational purposes, developed as part of the Operating Systems course at UFPR.

## Project Overview

PingPongOS is a didactic operating system that implements basic operating system concepts including:
- Task management
- Scheduling
- Synchronization
- Inter-process communication

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler
- Make

### Building

To build the project:
```bash
make
```

To build with debug flags:
```bash
make debug
```

To build with specific log level (1-5):
```bash
make log_1  # Minimal logging
# ...
make log_5  # Maximum logging
```

To build and run tests:
```bash
make tests
```

## Project Structure

- `ppos_src/`: Core operating system source files
- `tests/`: Test programs
- `queue/`: Queue implementation
- `dispatcher/`: Task dispatcher
- `timer/`: Timer management

## Running Tests

After building the tests with `make tests`, you can run individual test programs from the `tests/` directory. For example:

```bash
./tests/queue_test
